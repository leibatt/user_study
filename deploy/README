The files in this directory are templates for setting up a mod_wsgi application with apache2.
Just replace all the paths with their appropriate path values, and change
the wsgi alias to the appropriate alias value for the website.
Note also that if you want apache to serve the static files, you need
to replace all the url_for calls in the templates.

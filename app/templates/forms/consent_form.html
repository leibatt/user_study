	<h1>CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN NON-BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH</h1>
	<h2>Expert-User Analysis of ScalaR</h2>
	<div id="intro">
		<p>
You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by Michael Stonebraker (Ph.D.), and Leilani Battle (B.S.), from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a domain scientist interested in visual exploration of big data, particularly with NASA MODIS satellite imagery data. You should read the information below, and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to participate.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Participation and Withdrawal</h3>
	<div id="participation">
		<p>
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind.  The investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
	<div id="purpose">
		<p>
The purpose of this study is to gauge the effictiveness of a data visualization tool we created called ScalaR. ScalaR is a database exploration tool for big data exploration, and was designed with researchers and scientists in mind.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Procedures</h3>
	<div id="procedures">
		<p>
Participation in the study is expected to take 60 minutes, and time estimates for each procedure are given below. Note that participation of the study must be online via a website provided by the Investigators. If you volunteer to participate in this study, we would ask you to do the following things:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Complete 2 questionnaires (10 minutes):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A demographics questionnaire at the beginning of the experiment</li>
					<li>A satisfaction survey at the end of the experiment</li>
				</ul>
			</i>
			<li>
				<p>Learn how to use ScalaR (10 minutes):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Read a short introduction to ScalaR's functionality</li>
					<li>Explore ScalaR's  functionality on a simple data set</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Complete two research-related tasks using ScalaR (40 minutes):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identify subsets of the provided data sets that meet given visual requirements using ScalaR</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Potential Risks and Discomforts</h3>
	<div id="risks">
		<p>
We do not forsee any sigificant risks in participating in this study.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Potential Benefits</h3>
	<div id="benefits">
		<p>

ScalaR is already available online for use. If proven to be useful as a result of this study, ScalaR will provide scientists with a way to perform fast visual exploration of massive-scale data sets.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Payment for Participation</h3>
	<div id="payment">
		<p>
No payment or compensation will be offered for completing this study.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
	<div id="confidentiality">
		<p>
Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. 
		</p>
		<p>
Your interactions with ScalaR (button presses, mouse clicks, etc.) will be recorded through the website, and your responses to the questionnaires will be saved. No personal or identifiable information is recorded and all data collected from participants will be assigned and accessed by a randomly generated participant ID.
		</p>
		<p>
Data obtained from participants will be stored on a server located in a locked room in our lab. Internet access to the server is restricted to only individuals with proper login credentials for the server. The data will not be destroyed after analysis, and will remain on the server with the same security measures described above.

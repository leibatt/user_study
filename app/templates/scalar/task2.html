    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
In Task 2, you will identify regions in [location] with high amounts of snow cover.
You will need to navigate to the tiles representing [location] in the data set, 
and find as many tiles as you can within [locaiton] that meet the goal requirements described below.
    </p>
    <h2>What You Need to Know</h2>
    <p><strong>About the Data Set</strong>
: The Task 2 data set is the same data set used for Task 1. This data set is is a 2D array
containing Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) calculations from the MODIS satellite imagery
data set. The two dimensions are latitude (x) and longitude (y). A high NDSI value (1.0) means that
particular latitude/longitude area contains a high amount of snow. A low value (-1.0) means that
particular part of the earth does not contain snow. Large bodies of water of water (i.e.
oceans, lakes, rivers) appear as if they contain high amounts of snow. Add a land/sea mask filter to ignore them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Goal(s)</strong>
: Find tiles in [location] where half the visualization consists of high NDSI (> 0.5) values (i.e. regions of the earth with 50% snow cover).

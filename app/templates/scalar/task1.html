    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
In Task 1, you will identify regions in the continental United States with relatively high amounts of snow cover.
You will need to navigate to the tiles representing the United States in the data set, 
and find tiles in this area that meet the goal requirements described below.
    </p>
    <p><strong>About the Data Set</strong>
: The Task 1 data set is a 2D array containing Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) calculations from the MODIS satellite imagery data set. The two dimensions are latitude (x) and longitude (y). A high NDSI value (1.0) means that particular latitude/longitude area contains a high amount of snow. A low value (-1.0) means that particular part of the earth does not contain snow. Large bodies of water (i.e.
oceans, lakes, rivers) appear as if they contain high amounts of snow. Add a land/sea mask filter to ignore them.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Goal(s)</strong>
: Find 4 tiles in the continental United States at zoom level 7
that appear to have the highest snowpacks (i.e, highest NDSI values).
Hint: Add a 'max_land_sea_mask' filter and adjust the filter range to ignore high mask values (i.e. 4+).
These values translate to false positives around large bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers.
